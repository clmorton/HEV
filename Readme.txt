This collection of files and folders represents a walkthrough of a project conducted at the University of Leeds Institute for Transport Studies which examined the demand for Hybrid Electric Vehicles in the United Kingdom from a spatial perspective.

The project has been built in the R statistical programming language (URL) with the aid of the RStudio (URL) project management overlay. The analysis also requires  the use of a number of R packages.  

The analysis has been published in the journal of transport policy and can be viewed at the following URL:

The folders contain the following resources which will allow for the replication of the analysis presented in the paper. 

Data: contains a spreadsheet which incorporates the variables that are used in the analysis

Shapefiles: contains files which define the spatial characteristics used in the analysis

Code: contains the R scripts utilised to perform the analysis
