## Introduction

- This walkthrough is intended to demonstrate how to use the R programming environment to conduct a research project
- A series of packages will be used, with particular attention paid to  SPDEP 
- The walkthrough concentrates on a spatial analysis of the adoption of Hybrid Electric Vehicles in the UK
- You can get the project files from the following GitHub repository:
- Please feel free to use this code in your our analyses in the future
- This is a practical demonstration and will not cover underlining statistical theory

## Hybrid Electric Vehicle Adoption

- Co-authored with Robin Lovelace and Jillian Anable
- Published in Transport Policy

## SPDEP Package

- Available on CRAN and includes a number of functions for spatial analysis and spatial econometrics
- Allows for the production of spatial regression models using areal data
