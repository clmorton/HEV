## Introduction

- This walkthrough is intended to demonstrate how to use the R programming environment to **conduct a research project**
- A series of packages will be used, with particular attention paid to  **SPDEP** 
- The walkthrough concentrates on a spatial analysis of the **adoption of Hybrid Electric Vehicles in the UK**
- You can get the project files from the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/clmorton/HEV
- Please feel free to **use this code in your our analyses** in the future
- This is a practical demonstration and will not cover underlining statistical theory

## SPDEP Package

- Available on CRAN and includes a number of functions for **spatial analysis and spatial econometrics**
- Facilitates the production of **spatial weights matrice**
- Has functions to calculate **spatial autocorrelation statistics**
- Allows for the estimation of **spatial regression models** using areal data

## Hybrid Electric Vehicle Adoption


- Examines spatial variation in the **adoption of HEVs** across the local authorities of the UK
- Determines Whether the spatial variation displays any significant **geographic organisation**
- Considers if the rate of HEV uptake is associated with **nearness to the London Congestion Charge**
